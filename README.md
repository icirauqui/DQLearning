# Deep Q-Learning

Deep Q Learning algorithm that finds out the shortest path across a warehouse.

Starting from github projects NN and QLearning, aims to create a Reinforcement Learning algorithm in C++ from scratch.

It uses 2 Deep Neural Networks (Main and Target) that update via Bellman's Equation.
